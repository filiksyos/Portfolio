Hello! My name is Filiksyos, but you can call me Fili. I'm a software engineer focused on crafting efficient, innovative digital solutions. My experience in web development has equipped me with the skills to build dynamic, user-friendly websites, and I stay updated on the latest tech trends in this rapidly evolving field. Creating engaging online experiences is at the core of what I do.

Since 2022, I have been applying my AI prompting skills, creating AI apps and prompts for sale. Currently, I'm focused on freelance work and expanding my skills in frameworks like Cursor and Notion. I'm also developing my personal website with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The design is inspired by <a href='https://nevflynn.com' target='_blank'>nevflynn.com</a>. For a closer look at my work, you can explore my GitHub repository <a href='https://github.com/filiksyos/portfolio' target='_blank'>here</a>.
