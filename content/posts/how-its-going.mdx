Hello! My name is Filiksyos, but you can call me Fili. I have been highly interested in productivity childhood. Afterall, why waste a single joule of energy? That is why I chose the path of entrepreneurship-- to provide and receive value with the least amount of energy spent. 

When I was 18, ChatGPT was released for the first time. That was when I became infatuated with AI productivity. I mastered ChatGPT and other AI models to do the most boring tasks such as writing essay, researching and even coing. That was the same time I started studying software Engineering at Bahir dar university. 

By 19, I decided to join my coding and AI prompting skills, starting with android app development. And since then, I have built a couple of awesome apps, learning digital productivity along the way. Nowadays, I can make industry level apps in a few days using tools such as Cursor AI and Notion. I finished this very website in under 8 hours inspired by <a href='https://nevflynn.com' target='_blank'>nevflynn.com</a>. If it please, I would be glad to make your life easier as I made mine.
